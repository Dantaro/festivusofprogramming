# Festivus of Programming

In the town of Festiville, Wisconsin, the people don't celebrate Christmas ever since Santa ran over 
Old Mrs. Leery with his reindeer a few years back.  Instead they celebrate Festivus.  Your job will 
be to help set up for Noah Johnson's Festivus celebration, solving various problems, like figuring 
out who will actually show up after you factor in is on talking terms after Thanksgiving, and who 
should be picked for the Feats of Strength.
